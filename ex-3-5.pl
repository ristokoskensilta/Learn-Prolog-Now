% Binary trees are trees where all internal nodes have exactly two children. 
% The smallest binary trees consist of only one leaf node. We will represent 
% leaf nodes as leaf(Label) . For instance, leaf(3) and leaf(7) are leaf nodes, 
% and therefore small binary trees. Given two binary trees B1 and B2 we can 
% combine them into one binary tree using the functor tree/2 as follows: tree(B1,B2) . 
% So, from the leaves leaf(1) and leaf(2) we can build the binary tree 
% tree(leaf(1),leaf(2)) . And from the binary trees tree(leaf(1),leaf(2)) and 
% leaf(4) we can build the binary tree tree(tree(leaf(1),  leaf(2)),leaf(4)) . 
%
% Now, define a predicate swap/2 , which produces the mirror image of the binary 
% tree that is its first argument. For example:
%      ?-  swap(tree(tree(leaf(1),  leaf(2)),  leaf(4)),T). 

swap(leaf(X), leaf(X)).
swap(tree(X,Y), tree(Ys,Xs)) :- swap(Y, Ys), swap(X, Xs).
