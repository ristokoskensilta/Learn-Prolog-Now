% Exercise  5.2
% 1) Define a 2-place predicate increment that holds only when its second 
% argument is an integer one larger than its first argument. For example, 
% increment(4,5) should hold, but increment(4,6) should not.

increment(X,Y) :- Y is X + 1. 

% 2) Define a 3-place predicate sum that holds only when its third argument 
% is the sum of the first two arguments. For example, sum(4,5,9) should 
% hold, but sum(4,6,12) should not. 

sum(X,Y,Sum) :- Sum is X + Y.


%  Exercise  5.3 Write a predicate addone/2 whose first argument is a list 
% of integers, and whose second argument is the list of integers obtained 
% by adding 1 to each integer in the first list. For example, the query
%
%   ?-  addone([1,2,7,2],X).
%
% should give
%   X  =  [2,3,8,3]. 

addone([],[]).
addone([X|Xs],[Y|Ys]) :- Y is X + 1, addone(Xs,Ys).
